I can\'t even remember the story he was trying to tell me.\n\n   "Alright, continue."\n\n   "Oh right." What did happen? "She told me about how business was tough since the lemonade recession. Not enough children entering the job market at that age with enough capital apparently. The lemonade recession wasn\'t even the worst of it. Though it pales in comparison to how the Pomegranates plague. Glad that\'s over with. Almost as bad as the outbreak of Banana flu." Wait, I\'m digressing. "Anyway, we started talking."

An eerily unfamiliar pierce surreptitiously weak and needy.\n    It demands sacrifice. So picky, so needy as usual.\n\n    Stunning in its silence, above mortal perceptions and within new terrains of imagining. Who built it? Even the demons who attend it do not remember.\n    How can they when their own existence is a mystery to themselves. Their memories cannot last so long and be so strong. They remember the glimpses and\n    skimmers of a primitive time imbuing them with a primordial sense of what to expect.
