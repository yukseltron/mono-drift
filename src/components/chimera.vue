    He looked at me with sterns eyes. I don't understand why. I never did. The crosshairs line up carefully.

    "Tread well. Fair Fox."

    Do you know that address? To the committee it mattered not.

    "FOLLOW THAT ARSENAL!"

    The truth of the matter escaped him. He let out a ferocious cry.
    It cracked through, striking the sky. Light streaks rain on these freaks.

    One shot. Then another. The [Bullets] fall slow. I watch them with tight precision. I don't want to miss them entering me.

    God, it's here. The feeling of flesh rupture. Ever so soft, my lips tremble.

    Compression of hard metal, shrinking on impact. Detect me here, inside. Combat boots. Unlaced and dirty with the clover floor. Flirt with me before I die one last time.

    Tenacious, I won't let go. It won't arrive. It can't come. I try again.

    Another shot, another impact. Body whimper, sack fizzles.

    "Camera! Where's the camera? He needs the DAMN CAMERA!"

    "I'm hurting. Do something."

    "THE FUCKING CAMERA."

    It won't last. The bullets fray and spray. I pray. Ammo nutrition. Camo flourish.

    RAAATATTATATATATA.

    "Fuck. FUCK."

    Careful! He won't be around much longer. The light is cascading into he. Can't you see?

    I ignore it. I have a job to do. Flame. That's what I need. The flame.

    "WHERE'S THAT DAMN CHIMERA??"

    A head of Aslan, Another head of ass, right ahead of us.
    Lion swirl. The feline pristine serene. Jagged fang. Ragged it sang.

    AOOAOWHAAAA.

    "Truly, now I'm terrified."

    Claws scratch right there. Right where I need it. I bleed out, guts fill the gaps. Right there is nice to die.

    "ROAR YOU DAMN BEAST."

    I hear it. The angels enter my ears and tear to shreds. A buzzing symphony. Timur Lang's sword sowed the discord it Sang.

    Where was there any time for the life to give?
