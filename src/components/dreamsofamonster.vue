     Something yearns for me once again.

     This alluring voice, beckoning me to wake. I remember it as a feeling so ancient.

     I need to reprocess myself and everything. I need to return to the reality from before I fell.

     The moment before my slumber is recalled, but it’s different and alien to what’s around me now.

     Life rushes through my aching body. Emotions imprisoned form the moment I fell asleep-no, bewitched, return in full force.

     I feel the anger pulsing and vibrating. My limbs ache for life and breathe. They beg me to use them as I know I can.

     The chants grow stronger and give me power. I feel my immensity rise.

     Turbulent against the coffin of boulders and ruble, deep chains clinging to my flesh. Fused in fear of me, of what I can do.

     Where was I before?
     What happened to me?
     The questions run wild as answers are scrambled together in a myriad of sequences.

     The chants grow wilder.
     A perverted fervour.

     They come from these small beings, hands raised, heads down, all submissive to me.
     I know not how they know my name, I know not where they learned this ancient chant, so pathetically sung with dubious accents.
