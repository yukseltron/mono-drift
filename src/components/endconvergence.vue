      <br/>
      <br/>
      Ayvin? Can you hear me?<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      His eyes flutter awake.<br/>
      Absorbing the soft flares of light surrounding him. It's a bed. <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I'm on a bed. What a comfy bed.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It was true.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      A soothing softness saves his grace.<br/>
      An immaculate sense of comfort that lulled him to peace.<br/>
      It almost made him forget he simply had no idea where he was.<br/>
      What was the last thing he remembered?<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Ayvin, this must be very sensational to you, so try to take it slowly. I will explain to you as you readjust yourself to your new surrounding.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Am... I alive?<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Ayvin that is a very difficult question to answer, but for now, it would be alright to say that yes, you are indeed still alive.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As he tries to get up, a sudden pounding came into his head. His feet felt missing.<br/>
      A shockwave of dysphoria.<br/>
      Vertigo.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Where am I?<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Ayvin, It appears your body is encountering some adjustment issues.<br/>
      Your neural somatic mapping is off circuit.<br/>
      I sense you're going through what you would consider to be an 'physio-emotional dissonance'.<br/>
      Very old stuff that is.<br/>
      Back when psychology was still separate from physiology.<br/>
      You could not imagine the trouble it was to scour through the archives.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Ayvin can barely stand as he wilts back into the soft bed.<br/>
      The grasps calm him as his breathing regulates.<br/>
      He can feel the bed caress past his body, massaging his inner organs with newfound life.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I suggest you remain resting until your body's time shock is relaxed.<br/>
      This will only take a few minutes. I know it's a long time, but I cannot apply my medical services<br/>
      To you at your current state. Ayvin, you are a remarkable find.<br/>
      To find a human body untouched by any nano-immune system is unheard of today.<br/>
      That alone would place you before the 3rd epoch. But you're much more than that Ayvin.<br/>
      You have no trace of physio-emotional stabilizers, neither organic nor synthetic. Your cerebral-reality connector is...<br/>
      Non-existant.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I don't know what any of that means. Where am I? Who are you?<br/>
      Ayvin could barely get words to fall out of his mouth<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Oh I apologize Ayvin. You're in a medical bay, back here, on Earth.<br/>
      My name is..."<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The voice pauses to ponder on what to say.<br/>
      Of course the voice had a name, but to use language to express it was something long forgotten.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It excited the voice to even think about. Languages had not been abandon, but more or less outmoded.<br/>
      It was a redundant with further advances. Language was incomplete, inaccurate.<br/>
      It failed to convey everything effectively.<br/>
      Like many things it was uplifted by the great convergence between the qualitative and quantitative.<br/>
      Knowledge of language as it used to be remains in the archives, a victim to dust.<br/>
      If dust still existed.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But to some, the past was still full of amazement.<br/>
      The voice barely knew the intoxicating rush of being limited to mere words.<br/>
      The books it read, full of inconsistencies and inaccuracies. In an instant, all could be read and consumed.<br/>
      Effort was not weighed by time, for time was infinite.<br/>
      Time was extinct.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      All the pleasure derived from time and investment could be gained instantaneously.<br/>
      The voice knew this, yet deliberately took its time, page by page, allowing itself to suffer.<br/>
      An emotion so rare, the archives claim it extinct after the 1st epoch.<br/>
      It remembered the first book it read. Nostromo.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My name is Costa. Costa Guana.<br/>
      You're on Earth, 9th epoch.<br/>
      To put things into perspective Ayvin, you are a human from the 1 epoch, that is, year 5225.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      His mind was a puzzle, trying to piece together memories and the new info Costa kept giving him.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Ayvin, consider this.<br/>
      The sun was to die 5 billion years after your time.<br/>
      We've now moved past that point by another 5 billion years.<br/>
      You've arrived to convergence. You're arrived to Utopia. Congratulations.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I do not feel all that happy. Nothing makes sense. How did I get here.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      That itself is remarkable.<br/>
      Natural time-space flashforward capabilities did not exist until the 4th epoch.<br/>
      At least, we did not think it did. But a temporal accident may have allowed you to come here.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      How do you know this? How were you there in the past? Can you send me back then?<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Understand, we cannot truly go back in time, that idea requires a primitive sense of time.<br/>
      Instead it is more accurate to say we can "experience" the past, the same way your memories remind you of the past.<br/>
      I cannot send you back in time, but I can make it feel as though you're still there.<br/>
      Your brain and senses can be reconfigured to exist and perceive reality as though you are still<br/>
      In your own time. But understand it would be an advanced form of simulation.<br/>
      Though people nowadays would argue that the term simulation is inaccurate.<br/>
      But again, it is the closest word my readers tell me you'd most understand.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Ok then. Costa, tell me everything.<br/>
      Tell me what's happened. Tell me where I am and where I'm heading.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Costa began. He explained how humanity had finally reached convergence.<br/>
      It was a philosophical breakthrough.<br/>
      Something all of humanity had been working towards, almost unknowingly.<br/>
      The achievement of achievements.<br/>
      The triumph of triumphs.<br/>
      It was Nirvana, zen, peace, submission and freedom all at once.<br/>
      A cosmic balance with reality. A theological dance with technology.<br/>
      How left and right became one, middle and everything.<br/>
      How the discrete became continuous and the continuous discrete.<br/>
      The infinite as finite and the finite as infinite.<br/>
      The emotional and the rational in singularity and multiplicity.<br/>
      Time and space as one and both and neither at the same time.<br/>
      Effortless effort. A fusion and fission of everything.<br/>
      But Costa did not explain all this through mere words.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Words could never capture something boundless.<br/>
      Costa gave it to him, made it enter his corporeal form, allowed him to accept a vast truth every human being in history works towards.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Ayvin rose and knew what to do next. He thanked Costa, and vanished.<br/>
