     Do you remember Childe? Do you remember the past?   <br/>
     The forgotten trees that gave no root? The aquatics before their gills?   <br/>
     The water before it fell from skies? The crisp ground that knew no dirt?   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
     No, Phather.   <br/>
     It was before I knew you. Before the awakening.   <br/>
     I've only empathized about it in the supertexts.   <br/>
     They claim much beauty.   <br/>


     Ah, but what about before then? Long before.   <br/>
     So far back, we can only fathom to comprehend it?   <br/>
     Back when our ideas were small, and our wills were molecules.   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
     I don't understand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
     You don't need to.   <br/>
     Not really.   <br/>
     I mean how can you.   <br/>
     It's not your fault.   <br/>
     Some things must be shown.   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
     You're scaring me.   <br/>
     No one has gone that far back.   <br/>
     It's prohibited.   <br/>
     The Pact states-   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
     The Pact won't know.   <br/>
     They cannot.   <br/>
     They've lost the power to do so.   <br/>
     Maybe I have as well.   <br/>
     Maybe it's why I brought you here.   <br/>
     Maybe I need to find out.   <br/>
   <br/>   <br/>

     But why me?   <br/>
     Why choose me?   <br/>
   <br/>
     Because I trust you.   <br/>
     From our past together, I know how you are.   <br/>
     I know you yearn to find out, but just like me, you are afraid.   <br/>
     Not this time.   <br/>
     My courage only exists if I'm with you.   <br/>
   <br/>   <br/>

     The machine shakes and grinds.   <br/>
     Singing halos dance in cascades.   <br/>
     The aura of time bends and folds in convex and complex patterns.   <br/>
     Geometry of the 5th degree chains together, unweaving the gooey fabric.   <br/>
     The bridge is born, held aloft by  constantly repairing chaotic crystals.   <br/>
     The void opens. Bleak in anger for its disturbance.   <br/>
     A pain unpronounceable.   <br/>
     In the past, the machine would rip and tear until the void gave way or destroyed it.   <br/>
     In eons since, it now does its best to slip through unnoticed. The void cannot retaliate as it once did. Unless, you dared to breach closer.   <br/>

   <br/>   <br/>
     Childe, I have dreamed of this for so long.   <br/>
     My legs have been so weak believing I'd never be where we are now.   <br/>
   <br/>   <br/>

     I don't know, this is very unsettling.   <br/>
     Maybe the Pact was right.   <br/>

   <br/>   <br/>
     Fuck the Pact!   <br/>
     They won't stop us! They can't find us.   <br/>
   <br/>   <br/>

     With that, he cranks the machine closer, past the warnings.   <br/>
   <br/>   <br/>

     Sublime barriers ricochet as the machine pierces through.   <br/>
     The vibrant rainbows leak out in frustration, jettisoning through the path of least resistance.   <br/>
     The void schisms and postulates uncomfortably.   <br/>
   <br/>   <br/>

     I ask myself if I dare look up, into the void.   <br/>
     I know where to gaze, my whole body knows.   <br/>
     The one direction I must avoid.   <br/>
     But how can I?   <br/>
     Especially now, when I've already thrown my life into the abyss.   <br/>
     If I live, I'll never die again.   <br/>
     I steady my hands, and surrender to my inhibitions.   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
     This is too much!   <br/>
     I can feel myself crumbling!   <br/>
     Stop please!   <br/>
   <br/>   <br/>
     I don't think I can.   <br/>
     I don't know anymore.   <br/>
   <br/>
     He looks onward, acting oblivious to Childe's complaints.   <br/>
     It's too late.   <br/>
     There is no bridge, no era to return to.   <br/>
     This moment was made concrete long ago.   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
     He's gone mad.   <br/>
     I can see it in his shaky, unfastened eyes.   <br/>
     Nothing else matters to him now.   <br/>
     After all, is there anything else here remaining?   <br/>
     Where are we?   <br/>
     What have we become?   <br/>
     Before I can think, I find myself crying.   <br/>
     I submit to my fears, to my demise.   <br/>
     An overwhelming rush of neurons firing in spasms, unable to comprehend the magnitude.   <br/>
     God, protect me. I am weak after all.   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
     Another voice braves the calm.   <br/>
     It beckons me to look further, deeper inwards.   <br/>
     The trees retract their roots.   <br/>
     The beasts lose their bones.   <br/>
     The airs coalesces.   <br/>
     The clouds forget how to fly.   <br/>
     God give me strength, I must continue.   <br/>

   <br/>   <br/>
     Am I dead?   <br/>
     Something makes me think so.   <br/>
     I can feel the ground beneath me, but I wouldn't call it "ground".   <br/>
     It's no ground I know.   <br/>
     It's not what you would call "ground" either.   <br/>
     It's hard to explain.   <br/>
     Imagine the thing you define as ground, and banish it.   <br/>
     Then imagine you are where I am right now.   <br/>
     It's impossible I know, but you understand why I can't explain it to you.   <br/>

   <br/>   <br/>
     Am I alive?   <br/>
     I want to believe so.   <br/>
     I can feel the rush of the first winds.   <br/>
     It's a soothing caress so alien to what I've known.   <br/>
     Yet so familiar.   <br/>
     My memory prongs at how the air feels.   <br/>
     It fires the same synapses in me, but something is off.   <br/>
     Something is alien.   <br/>
     Its almost as though my skin is causing the air to react.   <br/>
     As though my age is trumping its age.   <br/>

   <br/>   <br/>
     The machine dissipates.   <br/>

   <br/>   <br/>
     The calm returns.   <br/>
