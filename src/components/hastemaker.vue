     Do you remember Childe? Do you remember the past?
     The forgotten trees that gave no root? The aquatics before their gills?
     The water before it fell from skies? The crisp ground that knew no dirt?


     No, Phather.
     It was before I knew you. Before the awakening.
     I've only empathized about it in the supertexts.
     They claim much beauty.


     Ah, but what about before then? Long before.
     So far back, we can only fathom to comprehend it?
     Back when our ideas were small, and our wills were molecules.


     I don't understand.


     You don't need to.
     Not really.
     I mean how can you.
     It's not your fault.
     Some things must be shown.


     You're scaring me.
     No one has gone that far back.
     It's prohibited.
     The Pact states-


     The Pact won't know.
     They cannot.
     They've lost the power to do so.
     Maybe I have as well.
     Maybe it's why I brought you here.
     Maybe I need to find out.


     But why me?
     Why choose me?

     Because I trust you.
     From our past together, I know how you are.
     I know you yearn to find out, but just like me, you are afraid.
     Not this time.
     My courage only exists if I'm with you.


     The machine shakes and grinds.
     Singing halos dance in cascades.
     The aura of time bends and folds in convex and complex patterns.
     Geometry of the 5th degree chains together, unweaving the gooey fabric.
     The bridge is born, held aloft by  constantly repairing chaotic crystals.
     The void opens. Bleak in anger for its disturbance.
     A pain unpronounceable.
     In the past, the machine would rip and tear until the void gave way or destroyed it.
     In eons since, it now does its best to slip through unnoticed. The void cannot retaliate as it once did. Unless, you dared to breach closer.


     Childe, I have dreamed of this for so long.
     My legs have been so weak believing I'd never be where we are now.


     I don't know, this is very unsettling.
     Maybe the Pact was right.


     Fuck the Pact!
     They won't stop us! They can't find us.


     With that, he cranks the machine closer, past the warnings.


     Sublime barriers ricochet as the machine pierces through.
     The vibrant rainbows leak out in frustration, jettisoning through the path of least resistance.
     The void schisms and postulates uncomfortably.


     I ask myself if I dare look up, into the void.
     I know where to gaze, my whole body knows.
     The one direction I must avoid.
     But how can I?
     Especially now, when I've already thrown my life into the abyss.
     If I live, I'll never die again.
     I steady my hands, and surrender to my inhibitions.


     This is too much!
     I can feel myself crumbling!
     Stop please!


     I don't think I can.
     I don't know anymore.

     He looks onward, acting oblivious to Childe's complaints.
     It's too late.
     There is no bridge, no era to return to.
     This moment was made concrete long ago.


     He's gone mad.
     I can see it in his shaky, unfastened eyes.
     Nothing else matters to him now.
     After all, is there anything else here remaining?
     Where are we?
     What have we become?
     Before I can think, I find myself crying.
     I submit to my fears, to my demise.
     An overwhelming rush of neurons firing in spasms, unable to comprehend the magnitude.
     God, protect me. I am weak after all.


     Another voice braves the calm.
     It beckons me to look further, deeper inwards.
     The trees retract their roots.
     The beasts lose their bones.
     The airs coalesces.
     The clouds forget how to fly.
     God give me strength, I must continue.


     Am I dead?
     Something makes me think so.
     I can feel the ground beneath me, but I wouldn't call it "ground".
     It's no ground I know.
     It's not what you would call "ground" either.
     It's hard to explain.
     Imagine the thing you define as ground, and banish it.
     Then imagine you are where I am right now.
     It's impossible I know, but you understand why I can't explain it to you.


     Am I alive?
     I want to believe so.
     I can feel the rush of the first winds.
     It's a soothing caress so alien to what I've known.
     Yet so familiar.
     My memory prongs at how the air feels.
     It fires the same synapses in me, but something is off.
     Something is alien.
     Its almost as though my skin is causing the air to react.
     As though my age is trumping its age.


     The machine dissipates.


     The calm returns.
