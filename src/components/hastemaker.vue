     "ERROR, IT CANNOT BE READ. EXPIRED SINCE: NINE-A-TWELVE.<br/>
     CENTURY A-SIX"<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With a whirr, the machine spits back out a small grey card.<br/>
     The card is chipped and bent at the corners. <br/>
     Parts of it still retain its gloss, while most of it is skinned, exposing thin strands of plastic bleached by the sun pealing off.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With shaking fingers, he gingerly grabs the card, quickly grooms it to satisfy the machine's taste, and tries again.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "ERROR, IT CANNOT BE READ. EXPIRED SINCE: NINE-A-TWELVE. CENTURY A-SIX"<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The repeated reply frustrates the man, and he wrenches a fist loose from his pockets.<br/>
     With a tightened grip, a flimsy punch is directed to the shiny metal screen of the machine.<br/>
     The machine remains unaffected and apathetic. <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In response it simply ejects the card back out. The man grabs it again and stuffs it away. He has other ideas.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "HELLO, PLEASE ENTER YOUR CARD."<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rummaging through his bag, a faint howl is heard in a distance. Barely audible, it grips the man's fear and attention. <br/>
     He listens diligently to confirm his fears, but the howl fades out. Anxious, he becomes frantic as he tosses all non essentials from his bag,<br/>
     looking for whatever he needs.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The machine looks on.<br/>
     Its screen, dulled from constant bleaching from the sun, emits but a soft glow as the sky darkens for the looming night.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As he searches through his bag, he picks things he deems will be useful in the near future.<br/>
     A gun, a small ring, and a device unknown to most.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The soft howls return from the distance. No need for doubt this time, his instincts tell him to be wary.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They're coming.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A quick check to reassure himself there's ammunition, and the gun is put to his side, ready for use.<br/>
     He places the ring between his front teeth, <br/>
     and bites down hard. Hands shaking, he grips the mysterious device and activates it. Or maybe it activated itself. <br/>
     There was no clear action for how he did it. For an observer, it's as if the device just woke on its own.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thin tendrils emerge from the device and wrap around his wrist.<br/>
     They're a cool black and glimmer from the machine's light. <br/>
     A snakes belly slithering to safety. Together they seamlessly tighten.<br/>
     The man can feel his blood halt as his hand goes numb. <br/>
     The device flips open with a static whir. A buzz that stabs his hears.<br/>
     It barely covers the sounds of hounds having caught the scent of their prey.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As the buzzing intensifies, it starts spinning rapidly.<br/>
     The force increases drastically, and the man realizes he is no longer gripping the device. <br/>
     The tendrils themselves make sure he never lets go.<br/>
     His teeth clamp down further into the ring as it too starts vibrating in response to the device.<br/>
     It does its best to wrestle free, but the man is more desperate to hold it in place.<br/>
     He closes his eyes as he lets the device do its magic. He's done this before, but it never gets easier.<br/>
     He never thought he'd have to use it so soon again.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Roars and howls come crashing through the horizon.<br/>
     A stampede of bloodthirst.<br/>
     All unified in a single competitive goal to take the man down. Hounds and killers and machines.<br/>
     They loom on their target, eager to grab hold of him.<br/>
     The sight of the device, their true prize, pushes them to rush faster.<br/>
     The man keeps his eyes shut, unwilling to turn and see them breathe down his neck.<br/>
     Praying for the machine to take him away.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They come for him. Bearing teeth and knives.<br/>
     Incapable of focusing on anything else.<br/>
     Gaze fixed on the brink of insanity. Dying for the release.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A loud burst. Blinding light and heat erupting everywhere.<br/>
     A fuzz that tickles and trickles through your brain, down your stem, all throughout your body.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He opens his eyes. He's gone. They're gone. It's all gone.<br/>
     Why is he back here again? Why did he use the device? His hand is empty.<br/>
     The device is gone. The black tendrils didn't even leave a mark.<br/>
     What was he holding before?<br/>
     <br/><br/>
     The machine beeps at him.<br/>
     <br/><br/>
     "HELLO, PLEASE ENTER YOUR CARD."<br/>
     <br/><br/>
     Without thinking, he takes out his card and follows as instructed.<br/>
     <br/><br/>
     "THANK YOU, YOU'VE BEEN ACCEPTED. PLEASE WAIT TO ENTER."<br/>
     <br/><br/>
     The screen darkens and the machine changes life.<br/>
