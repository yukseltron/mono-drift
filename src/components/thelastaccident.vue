      The machine works I can feel it.<br/>
      It's an intensely revolutionary idea, something we should all congratulate ourselves for.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He likes his wine and grandiose speeches.<br/>
      In fact, he's just finished a thirty minute vapid shelling of congrats.<br/>
      But not all the words are in vain, it's simply just his sentiments to the staff and team.<br/>
      They know who he truly is deep inside. They can see how is eyes seem transfixed more on the machine.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Its silver glints and red lights strike across the open field.<br/>
      With everyone sitting comfortably in an eloquent watch tower, it is an impressive view of the technical marvel.<br/>
      <br/><br/>

      The team of scientists, engineers around him all carefully give toast.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      For most of them, their jobs are done.<br/>
      Several years of clandestine construction of the previously impossible machine was no easy feat.<br/>
      Many sacrificed time with family, friends, even themselves to achieve the businessman's dreams.<br/>
      He ensured only the best could work on the machine, and gave them promises to devote their life and meaning to the depths of what their great minds could reach.<br/>
      Many allowed their obsessions to consume them and bring them to new peaks of engineering.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Old rules were forgotten. Strict morals were abandoned. For a small amount of time, they were allowed to defy reality.<br/>
