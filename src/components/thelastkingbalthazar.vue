     BALTHAZAR

     ///////////////





     “Wake up!”


     He hits the pillow hard.  A fist so turbulent my head shakes. Uncomforted.


     “Why did you do that?”


     A few streaks of sunlight burst through to strike my eyes and glare me blind. It’s too soon and my body can’t catch up as I  restart my system.

     “Follow me quickly. The time we’ve been waiting for has come.”


     He walks out and unveils the curtains. The city slums and streets to my surprise are shrouded by the night sky and vapid rain.

     “Where did the sun go?”


     “What mean you? It’s already night and we’re late. You take too long to leave your bed. Fool. Balthazar awaits our presence.”


     Here the demons of the city rest. Opaque in blind sight. The cower and conform and await their beckoning for the reckoning.
     But the promised time has taken so long.
     Has it really arrived?

     The shrine of Balthazar. Kept dainty and unsightly through diligent preservation rests solemnly in the middle of the city. To regular eyes, there’s nothing to behold.
     In a plane above light, a relic of transcended dimensions.

     “Are you ready?”

     “I’ve been ready for thousands of years. I remember the time before the concrete. I remember the hot floors and soft dirt.”

     The day is bright, but only if you keep your eyes peeled. Close them, shut them and you will see in the darkness the shrine and coming.
     The demons hear the faint call, a prophecy spoken long ago by a timid voice eager to be heard. An eerily unfamiliar pierce surreptitiously weak and needy.
     It demands sacrifice. So picky, so needy as usual.

     Stunning in its silence, above mortal perceptions and within new terrains of imagining. Who built it? Even the demons who attend it do not remember.
     How can they when their own existence is a mystery to themselves. Their memories cannot last so long and be so strong. They remember the glimpses and
     skimmers of a primitive time imbuing them with a primordial sense of what to expect. The same sense and irks and quirks for their actions.
     Unrelenting and never dissipating, they react by instinct, unaware of the doom they impend.

     “Do you remember the king’s face? So handsome, so vibrant. It’s been so long, I grew worried we’d never see it again.”

     “You must be thinking of a different king. The one I remember was petrifying. A mass of dystrophic flesh that hangs from his head like a dead bird. No beauty in its horror.”

     A sneer. “Come, come. Let’s begin and see who remembers better.”

     The surround the shrine. Hands clasped together, they channel in synchronous hums their energy. It flows through their gates, smothering the shaking shrine.
     Cracks and bruises emerge and shrieks of humiliating torment ring out. A catacomb for one being. The passerby passes by oblivious.
     He cannot witness what he cannot comprehend. It assures the demons of their practice as they carefully erode the shrine.
     From death returns life as the last king rises.

     “I have returned. Bless me. It’s been so long. Now, remind me why I’m back here again.”

     The demons point to the scriptures across the walls. They all repeat the same chant.
     With a heavy acknowledgment, he bows his head and begins.
